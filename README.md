### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm simply a tech lover since I was a kid. Everything related to computer or that brings me even more close to them are on my radar. Besides being a professional developer nowadays, I have some considerable knowledge on almost all areas.

I love to assemble new machines, to play with my Raspberries, to install new operating systems on virtual machines, to keep an eye on all the tech news and to develop all little ideas that occur to me.

My main specialty is to think and design systems. I'm very very confortable with relational databases with all flavours and I'm a serious thinker and ridiculously creative. Have worked on dozens of projects, from small ones to really big corporative systems, from a lot of business areas and subjects.

I'm always eager to being learning something all the time, including English. I know cthat I do not sound like a native here or everytime I write or speak, but I'm writing this just from my head, without any help. So, sorry if the grammar is not perfect.

On my carrer, I've declined better positions on another areas just to pursuit my dream on working always on IT department. Then, I'm not available for opportunities out of this scope.

I have decided to write this file on English for fun and because one of my goals is to, one day, work remotely for an international company and who knows if this can help me or at least always remember me of this dream.

But I love to write and I do it regularly on my site/blog and you can visit it by the link below:

However I write using portuguese there and it's a little empty these days because I'm in a very tragic moment of my life that drained my will to write (surprinsingly writing this today)
